## A tale of two cities: blocking code vs. non-blocking code

**Abstract:**

We don’t have to exert much mental effort when writing blocking code, but this has drawbacks. Non-blocking code, on the other hand, could be used to increase application throughput. This is why non-blocking code is recommended in many scenarios. Over the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to writing code that does not block.

In this session, we will look into those options that are available to us. To begin, I’ll go over the evolution of the Java concurrency model since its inception with the vanilla thread. Then I will introduce Future/Callable, and CompletableFuture, briefly go over reactive programming, and finally conclude with the Project Loom that was added in Java 19.


## What You Won't Want to Miss: Top 10 Java Language Features
**Abstract:**
The pace at which new versions of Java are made available to the public remains exceptionally rapid. As a result, since Java 8, we have been introduced to a plethora of new features. Indeed, some of these brand-new options have already proven their worth in spades. Examples include lambda expressions, stream API, optional, immutable collections, enhanced switch statements, optionals, records, sealed classes, and many more.

In this talk, I will discuss the top 10 Java language features that are highly useful and worthwhile in our day-to-day programming lives.

## Java Threading Essentials: Novice to Expert
**Abstract:**

To be a proficient Java developer, you must learn Java Thread programming. "Thread" is the heart of the Java ecosystem. All the server-side programming models heavily depend on the Java concurrency model. In this session, I will explain a few essential aspects of the Java thread model from the ground up so that a beginner can build their concurrency knowledge on top of it.

The session will include;

- How to create a simple concurrent program
- Identify the benefits of Java threading.
- Understanding the bagasse that comes with threads and how to avoid them
- What are the threadsafe classes available in the JDK
