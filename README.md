## A tale of two cities: blocking code vs. non-blocking code

**Abstract:**

We don’t have to exert much mental effort when writing blocking code, but this has drawbacks. Non-blocking code, on the other hand, could be used to increase application throughput. This is why non-blocking code is recommended in many scenarios. Over the last two decades, many approaches have been introduced to writing code that does not block.

In this session, we will look into those options that are available to us. To begin, I’ll go over the evolution of the Java concurrency model since its inception with the vanilla thread. Then I will introduce Future/Callable, and CompletableFuture, briefly go over reactive programming, and finally conclude with the Project Loom that was added in Java 19.


## What You Won't Want to Miss: Top 10 Java Language Features
**Abstract:**
The pace at which new versions of Java are made available to the public remains exceptionally rapid. As a result, since Java 8, we have been introduced to a plethora of new features. Indeed, some of these brand-new options have already proven their worth in spades. Examples include lambda expressions, stream API, optional, immutable collections, enhanced switch statements, optionals, records, sealed classes, and many more.

In this talk, I will discuss the top 10 Java language features that are highly useful and worthwhile in our day-to-day programming lives.

## Java Threading Essentials: Novice to Expert
**Abstract:**

To be a proficient Java developer, you must learn Java Thread programming. "Thread" is the heart of the Java ecosystem. All the server-side programming models heavily depend on the Java concurrency model. In this session, I will explain a few essential aspects of the Java thread model from the ground up so that a beginner can build their concurrency knowledge on top of it.

The session will include;

- How to create a simple concurrent program
- Identify the benefits of Java threading.
- Understanding the bagasse that comes with threads and how to avoid them
- What are the threadsafe classes available in the JDK

## Your code on the Fastlane: catch up with everyone by using the new versions of Java
**Abstract:**
Moving your project to the latest Java can mean faster code, cheaper cloud bills, and many more. Just by using Java 11, you can save up to 25% of heap memory. Plus, If you write your code to the latest Java, it would become clearer, concise, and easy to read which means less chance to produce bugs.

Moving to the latest java version means many things. For example -

- You will be able to upgrade your Java skills with the latest version, which means you are no longer fall behind
- You will be able to write clear and concise code with the lambda expression, which means less chance to produce bugs
- You will be able to write declarative and expressive code easily, which means less code but more results
- You will learn how to refactor old legacy and imperative code with modern functional programming, which means less error in your code
- You will be able to process large data set in parallel, which means a faster result

In this short talk, I will demonstrate a few small and easy steps to upgrade your knowledge and java code to the latest version.
